COMP90049: Introduction to Machine Learning Project 2


This project2 is aimed to predict movie genre from Audio, Visual and Text Features by machine
learning methods.
There are two files for the project2,LinearModel.ipynb and NonLinearModel.ipynb
File LinearModel.ipynb contains two linear machine learning methods(Logistic Regression and 
Naive Bayes) and the evaluation of methods.
File NonLinearModel.ipynb contains one non-linear machine learning method(Neural Network).

======================
LinearModel.ipynb
======================

In this file, two linear machine learning methods(Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes) are 
implemented.

Code block 1 and Code block 2 are responsible for loading data and pre-processing data.
Code block 3 uses logistic regression for prediction imported from sklearn library, and then
calculate its accuracy.
Code block 4 calculates precision, recall and F-Score in macro averaging for logistic regression.
Code block 5 uses Naive Bayes for prediction imported from sklearn library, and then calculate 
its accuracy.
Code block 6 calculates precision, recall and F-Score in macro averaging for Naive Bayes.

======================
NonLinearModel.ipynb
======================

In this file, non-linear machine learning methods(Neural Network) is implemented.

Code block 1 and Code block 2 are responsible for loading training and validation features.
Code block 3 and Code block 4 are responsible for processing training and validation labels.
Code block 5 builds the Neural Network flow by tenorflow library.
Code block 6 runs the neural network and calculates its Accuracy.
Code block 7 calculates precision, recall and F-Score in macro averaging for neural network.
Code block 8 and Code block 9 predict the test feature and produce the .csv file for Kaggle.
